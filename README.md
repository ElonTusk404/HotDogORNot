# HotDogORNot
Telegram bot with TensorFlow Model for image Classification
The Silicon Valley Hotdog Classifier Telegram Bot is a fun and educational project that leverages the power of machine learning to classify images as either "hotdog" or "not hotdog," just like in the popular TV series Silicon Valley. This project combines the Telegram Bot API with a pre-trained TensorFlow model to provide users with a humorous and entertaining experience.
